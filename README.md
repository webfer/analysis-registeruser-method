## Pre-analysis ðŸš§ 
We already have a previous analysis that we can use as a beginning point, but that will have to be adjusted and improved. This is software for managing an online movie streaming platform.

As you can see in the starting diagram, users have an operation that returns the total amount paid for all the services they have requested. The price of a service is calculated as follows:

* For all users who want to watch multimedia content by streaming, the streaming price of this multimedia content is applied.
* For all users who want to download multimedia content from the platform, the download price of this multimedia content applies.
* If the content is premium, in any of the above cases the additional charge specified in the additionalFee attribute is added.

## Suppose the implementation of this method is like the following pseudocode:


```  
class RegisteredUser{
  
  constructor(services=[]){
    this.services = services;
  }
  
  getTotal () {
    let total = 0;
    
    this.services.forEach(service,index => {
      let multimediaContent = service.getMultimediaContent();
      
      if (typeof service == StreamingService) {
        total += multimediaContent.streamingPrice;
      } else if (typeof service == DownloadService) {
        total += multimediaContent.downloadPrice;
      }
      
      if (typeof multimediaContent == PremiumContent) {
        total += multimediaContent.additionalFee:
      }
      
    })
    
    return total
  }
}
```

## Questions

We reviewed the pseudocode of the `getTotal` method of the `RegisteredUser` class. We are concerned that its design is a little bit vulnerable as it is not clear whether it considers possible changes in the future, other scenarios and their impact:

* What problems do you detect in the operation and give us some reasons for your answer?
* Give us a propose an alternative solution (like in the example) that corrects the problems of the `getTotal` method of `RegisteredUser` class that you have detected in the previous question. Make all the changes you consider necessary in any of the classes of the statement.


## Analysis  ðŸš€
As a result of my initial analysis, my initial approach would be, that all the services should inherit from a common base class.
You can then give the base class a method that returns the cost. In this case `getCost()`. This method should be used just below the `multimediaContent` function, as well, as increment the price in every forEach function loop.

In addition, I have refactored the `if/else if` statement to switch statements to optimize.

```
/**
 *
 * @class RegisteredUser
 */

(() => {
  class RegisteredUser {
    constructor(services = []) {
      this.services = services;
    }

    getTotal() {
      let total = 0;
      this.services.forEach(service, (index) => {
        let multimediaContent = service.getMultimediaContent();
        total += this.getCost(multimediaContent);
      });
      return total;
    }

    getCost(multimediaContent) {
      switch (typeof service) {
        case service === StreamingService: {
          return multimediaContent.streamingPrice;
        }
        case service === DownloadService: {
          return multimediaContent.downloadPrice;
        }
        default: {
          return multimediaContent.additionalFee;
        }
      }
    }
  }
})();

```
## Conclusion
This is just a basic analysis. Also, this approach should be tested in a controlled environment within a real project, with more information available.
